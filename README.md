## Rules
Here's a summary of the key rules:

Objective: Caravan is a two-player game where each player has three piles of cards, known as caravans. The goal is to bring the total value of each pile to between 21 and 26.

Gameplay:

You begin by placing down three cards, one for each pile.
The second card placed decides the direction (up or down) for that pile.
Subsequent cards must continue in the set direction unless they are of the same suit.
Card Values and Special Cards:

Ace and 2-10 cards represent their standard numerical value.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) do not increase value but have special effects:
Queens reverse the direction of a pile.
Kings double the value of the card they are attached to.
Jacks remove the card they are attached to.
Deck Building: A caravan deck consists of 30 cards selected at the start of the match. Having cards of the same suit is advantageous.
